## Why mptools?

In recent years, spatially-explicit, coupled habitat-demographic models have
been developed to acknowledge the importance of population processes when
evaluating the impacts of habitat change (Keith *et al.* 2008, 2014; Southwell
*et al.* 2008; Fordham *et al.* 2012; Cadenhead *et al.* 2015). Frequently,
these coupled models use the Metapop module of RAMAS GIS (Ak√ßakaya & Root 2005)
to relate spatially-dynamic habitat suitability to carrying capacity, and then 
simulate metapopulation dynamics. Metapop saves settings, parameters values, and
simulation results to a text file (with .mp extension). Unfortunately, there is 
limited flexibility within Metapop regarding presentation of results, and 
extraction of results via the GUI is awkward.

**The `mptools` package provides several useful functions for extracting and
processing data from RAMAS Metapop .mp files.**

## Function overview:


Function      | Description 
---------     | ------------------------------------------------------------- 
`actions()`   | Extract management action details from .mp files 
`kch()`       | Extract carrying capacity times series from .kch files 
`knt()`       | Plot the carrying capacity and abundance dynamics of one or more populations
`meta()`      | Extract population details from .mp files
`mp2sp()`     | Create a `SpatialPointsDataFrame` representing the centroid of each population, with attributes `pop` (population name), `time` (the time step), and `N` (the mean population size)
`mp2xy()`     | Extract coordinates for populations from .mp files, and transform them to the original coordinate reference system
`mp_animate()`| Animate temporal habitat and abundance dynamics on a gridded landscape
`results()`   | Extract simulation results (mean, sd, min and max of population size), as well as expected minimum abundance (EMA) and its standard deviation, from .mp files
`ths()`       | Extract total habitat suitability from .ptc files.


## Examples

`mptools` comes packaged with some data relating to a RAMAS Metapop model. The
model is of a metapopulation of a hypothetical species, comprising 263
populations, the population dynamics of which have been simulated over 100
years. In reality, the number of populations, iterations, and time steps are
only limited by RAMAS Metapop itself, and the amount of memory available to R.

Most functions in the mptools package operate on RAMAS Metapop .mp files that
have been run and contain simulation results. An example .mp file representing
our hypothetical metapopulation is included in the package. The path to this
file is given by `system.file('example.mp', package='mptools')`. Here we assign
that path to the object `mp`.

```{r mpfile}
mp <- system.file('example.mp', package='mptools')
```

### `results()`: extract simulation results

To extract the simulation results, we use the `results` function, pointing it to
the .mp file. This extracts time series of the mean, minimum, maximum and 
standard deviation (across iterations) of abundance for each population; the 
minimum, maximum and terminal metapopulation abundance for each iteration; and 
calculates the expected minimum abundance (EMA; McCarthy & Thompson 2001) and
the standard deviation of minimum abundance.

```{r res, message=FALSE}
res <- results(mp=mp)
res
```

Summary information is printed by default, but the resulting list comprises
elements containing: the mean, minimum, maximum and standard deviation of
population size for each time step, given for each patch and for the
metapopulation as a whole (in element `results`); the minimum (`iter_min`),
maximum (`iter_max`) and final (`iter_terminal`) abundance across the time
horizon, for each iteration; the probability of quasi-extinction (i.e., the
proportion of iterations during which total abundance fell beneath a
predetermined threshold, `qe_prob`); the mean (`EMA`) and standard deviation
(`SDMA`) of minimum abundance. Additionally, some metadata about the simulation
is provided: the date and time that the model was run (`timestamp`); and the
number of populations (`n_pops`), time steps (`duration`), and iterations
(`n_iters`).

For example, the mean, minimum, maximum and standard deviation of total
population size at each time step (first six time steps shown here) is given by:

```{r res_head}
head(res$results[,, 'ALL'])
```
The same could be extracted for population 40, referring to it by name:

```{r res_head40}
head(res$results[,, 'Pop 40'])
```

### `meta()`: extract Metapop settings

The `meta` function returns a `data.frame` containing information about RAMAS
Metapop settings for each population, including their names, initial abundances,
density dependence types, carrying capacities, and maximum growth rates. Here
the first few rows are shown for brevity.

```{r meta, message=FALSE}
met <- meta(mp=mp)
head(met)
```

### `mp2xy()`: extract patch coordinates

RAMAS Metapop simulations are often based on spatial grids describing the
distribution of habitat (i.e., when using the Spatial Data module to identify
patch structure). In these cases, spatial coordinates are converted by RAMAS
such that they describe the position relative to the top left corner of the
grid. Such coordinates are returned by the `meta` function in the columns
`xMetapop` and `yMetapop`. In order to relate simulation results to the true
landscape, the original (untransformed) coordinates can be recovered with
`mp2xy`. This requires one of the original grids used by Spatial Data (or its
`Raster*` object representation), and knowledge of the cell length setting
passed to that module. By default, `mp2xy` creates a plot of the points,
overlaid upon the provided raster data.

The raster grids that were originally used to define the patch structure are
included with `mptools`. We pass one of them to `mp2xy`, below.

```{r xy, fig.width=6.6, fig.height=4.7}
library(raster)
tifs <- list.files(system.file(package='mptools'), '\\.tif$', full.names=TRUE)
xy <- mp2xy(mp=mp, r=tifs[1], cell.length=9.975)
head(xy)
```

Above we see that the `data.frame` returned by `mp2xy` includes the populations'
names, their RAMAS coordinates, and their original coordinates. In this case,
the original coordinates were defined by the Australian Albers equal area
coordinate system.

### `mp2sp()`: create a `SpatialPointsDataFrame` describing population dynamics

The coordinates returned by `mp2xy`, and the abundance at the corresponding
patches at each time step of the simulation, can be used to create a spatial
object that enables further analysis and visualisation. This is done with
`mp2sp`, which creates a `SpatialPointsDataFrame` with attributes containing the
average (across iterations) abundance at each patch, for each time step of the
simulation.

In the following example, we set `start` to 2000, indicating that the first time
step of the simulation corresponds to the year 2000. This controls labelling of
the shapefile's attributes---subsequent time steps are labelled with sequential
integers. Below we also pass the source and target [PROJ.4
strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROJ.4) describing the coordinate
reference system (CRS) for the input coordinates, and the output
`SpatialPointsDataFrame`, respectively.

```{r mp2sp, message=FALSE}
spdf <- mp2sp(mp=mp, coords=xy, start=2000, 
              s_p4s='+init=epsg:3577', t_p4s='+init=epsg:4326') 
```

Above, we indicated that the source CRS is Australian Albers (EPSG 3577) and the
target CRS is WGS 84 (EPSG 4326). (These could also be passed as [`CRS` 
objects](http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/sp/docs/CRS) rather than as
PROJ.4 strings.)

We can plot the output with `sp::spplot`, which can colour points according to
the value of an attribute:

```{r plot_spplot, fig.width=6.6, fig.height=3.6}
library(sp)
library(viridis)
spplot(subset(spdf, time==2000), zcol='N',  
       cuts=c(-Inf, 0, 10^(0:6)), key.space='right', 
       col.regions=c('gray80', viridis(100)))
```

We can then write these data out to an ESRI shapefile or KML for use in, e.g., a
GIS or Google Earth. For example, to write out as a shapefile, we can use:

```{r write_shp, message=FALSE}
library(rgdal)
writeOGR(spdf, dsn=tempdir(), layer='mp', driver='ESRI Shapefile', 
         overwrite_layer=TRUE)
```

The shapefile was written out to a file called "mp.shp" (along with its
accessory files) within the current temporary directory, which can be viewed
with `browseURL(tempdir())`.

To write out to KML, we include the output file name in the string passed to the
`dsn` argument, and specify the KML driver. Note that below, we subset the data
to the first time step (2000), to reduce the size of the output.

```{r write_kml}
library(rgdal)
writeOGR(subset(spdf, time==2000), dsn=file.path(tempdir(), 'mp.kml'), 
         layer='', driver='KML')
```

If Google Earth is installed on your system, and if .kml files are associated
with it, you can open the new .kml file with:

```{r show_kml, eval=FALSE}
file.show(file.path(tempdir(), 'mp.kml'))
```

Note that to display correctly in Google Earth, the data should be in the WGS 84
datum. When using `mp2xy` above, we ensured that `spdf` was transformed to WGS
84.

### `kch()`: extract carrying capacity dynamics from .kch files
If a model involves carrying capacity dynamics, RAMAS stores information about
these in .kch files. Changes in carrying capacity can be extracted from these
files with the `kch` function. Rather than show this as text output, we see
below how these carrying capacity sequences are used by `knt`, along with the
mean abundances returned by `results`. 

```{r kch}
k <- kch(meta=met, path=dirname(mp))
str(k)
```

### `knt()`: visualise carrying capacity and abundance dynamics
The `knt` function plots the change in carrying capacity and mean abundance 
through time, for each population, or for a given subset of populations. Below, 
we show these dynamics for four chosen populations. Black lines show mean total
abundance, and grey lines show carrying capacity. Populations whose names are
shown in bold on a blue background had positive abundance at the first time
step.

```{r knt, message=FALSE, fig.width=6.6, fig.height=6.6}
knt(meta=met, kch=k, pops=c('Pop 169', 'Pop 170', 'Pop 174', 'Pop 175'), 
    show_N=TRUE, results=res, samelims=TRUE, layout=c(2, 2))
```

### `mp_animate()`: animate habitat and abundance dynamics
With `mp_animate`, we can create a gif animation showing temporal dynamics in
habitat suitability and in carrying capacity. This can reveal lags in response
to changing habitat suitability. 

The function requires a `RasterStack` or `RasterBrick` with layers, describing
habitat change, in temporal order. The interval between successive rasters (i.e.,
the interval between time steps) is assumed to be constant. Below, we pass a 
`RasterStack` to `mp_animate`, comprising the rasters included with `mptools`.

```{r animate, message=FALSE}
library(raster)
tifs <- list.files(system.file(package='mptools'), '\\.tif$', full.names=TRUE)
spdf <- mp2sp(mp=mp, coords=xy, start=2000)
mp_animate(spdf, habitat=stack(tifs), outfile='dynamics.gif', zlim=c(0, 800), 
           width=630, height=615, overwrite=TRUE)
```

![](dynamics.gif)

Points indicate populated patches, with colours scaled linearly from white 
(mean abundance = 1) to black (mean abundance is equal to the maximum mean 
abundance across populations and years). Points are not shown when mean 
abundance is zero. The raster is coloured according to the carrying capacity of
the cell.
