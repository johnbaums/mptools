\title{Animate the output of a RAMAS Metapop simulation.}
\usage{
mp_animate(res, coords, habitat, outfile, zlim, axes = FALSE,
  col.regions = NULL, col.pts = NULL, pt.cex = 0.85, height = 800,
  width = 820, interval = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{An object containing the results of a RAMAS Metapop simulation. 
This object can be created by using \code{\link{results}}.}

\item{coords}{An object containing population coordinates. This object can be
created by using \code{\link{mp2xy}}.}

\item{habitat}{Either a file path containing habitat grids (names of grid 
files must end in an underscore followed by a number, e.g. 
example_001.asc), or a RasterStack or RasterBrick object. The number of 
files, or Raster* layers, should equal the number of simulation time steps.
If a file path is provided, files are ordered by the numeric component of 
their names.}

\item{outfile}{A character string giving the desired output path and 
filename.}

\item{zlim}{A numeric vector of length 2 giving the lower and upper limits of
the color scale indicating habitat quality.}

\item{axes}{Logical. Should axes be drawn?}

\item{col.regions}{A \code{\link{colorRampPalette}} function that will be 
used to generate the colour ramp for grids. If \code{NULL}, a default 
colour ramp based on \code{\link{terrain.colors}} is used.}

\item{col.pts}{A \code{\link{colorRampPalette}} function that will be used
to generate the colour ramp for points. These colours will be interpolated 
into 100 colours, which indicate relative mean population size, ranging 
from 1 (first element of the colour ramp) to the maximum mean population 
size that exists in the simulation output. If \code{NULL}, a default colour
ramp ranging from white to black is used.}

\item{pt.cex}{Point size magnifier, relative to the default.}

\item{height}{Numeric. The height of the animation, in pixels. Default is 
800.}

\item{width}{Numeric. The width of the animation, in pixels. Default is 820.}

\item{interval}{The time interval of the animation, in seconds. Default is 
0.05, i.e. 20 frames per second.}
}
\value{
\code{NULL}. The animation is saved as an animated .gif file at the
  specified path (\code{outfile}).
}
\description{
Animate temporal habitat and abundance dynamics on a gridded landscape.
}
\details{
An animated gif is created, with points indicating the location of
  populations with mean abundance greater than zero, overlaid upon a raster
  grid indicating habitat suitability. Relative population size is
  represented by point colour, with white corresponding to a population with 
  mean abundance between 0 and 1% of the maximum mean abundance across all
  populations and time steps, and black corresponding to the maximum mean
  abundance. Colours for intermediate values are scaled linearly. The colour
  key indicates carrying capacity, and corresponds to the colour of grid
  cells.
