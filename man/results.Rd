\title{Extract simulation results from RAMAS Metapop .mp files}
\usage{
results(mp)
}
\arguments{
\item{mp}{A character string containing the path to a RAMAS Metapop .mp file 
containing simulation results. E.g. file='/path/to/metapop.mp'}
}
\value{
A \code{list} containing: \item{results}{An array containing 
  simulation results extracted from \code{file}. The number of rows is equal 
  to the number of time steps in the simulation. The array has four columns, 
  containing mean, sd, min and max of population size across iterations at 
  each time step (i.e. each row), and the number of array slices is equal to 
  the number of populations. The third dimension is named according to 
  population names (numeric component only).} \item{minmaxterm}{A matrix 
  containing the minimum and maximum (across years), and terminal occupancy 
  for each iteration.} \item{qe_thr}{The quasi-extinction threshold. When the
  total abundance is beneath \code{qe_thr}, the metapopulation is considered
  to be quasi-extinct.} \item{qe_prob}{The probability and cumulative
  probability of exceeding the quasi-extinction threshold (\code{qe_thr}) at
  each time step.} \item{EMA}{The mean minimum abundance (i.e. the mean,
  across iterations, of the minimum abundance for each simulation 
  trajectory).} \item{SDMA}{The standard deviation of minimum abundance (i.e.
  the sd, across iterations, of the minimum abundance for each simulation 
  trajectory).} \item{timestamp}{A POSIXlt object representing the date and 
  time at which the simulation was completed.} \item{n_pops}{The number of
  populations in the simulation.} \item{duration}{The number of time steps in
  the simulation} \item{n_iters}{The number of iterations performed.}
}
\description{
Extracts population size simulation results (mean, sd, min and max),
including expected minimum abundance (EMA) and its standard deviation, from a
RAMAS Metapop .mp file.
}
\note{
This has been tested for RAMAS version 5.1, and may produce unexpected 
  results for other versions.

\examples{
f <- system.file('example.mp', package='mptools')
res <- results(f)
str(res)

# look at the simulation results for the first array slice (NB: this slice is
# all pops combined):
res$results[,, 1]
# equivalently, subset by name:
res$results[,, 'ALL']
res$results[,, 'Pop 190']
res$results[,, '240A24']
dimnames(res$results)[[3]] # population names

# return a matrix of mean population sizes, where columns represent
# populations and rows are time steps:
res$results[, 1, ] # or res$results[, 'mean', ]

# sd across iterations:
res$results[, 2, ] # or res$results[, 'sd', ]

# min pop sizes across iterations:
res$results[, 3, ] # or res$results[, 'min', ]

# max pop sizes across iterations:
res$results[, 4, ] # or res$results[, 'max', ]
