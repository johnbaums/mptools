\title{Back-transform RAMAS Metapop coordinates}
\usage{
mp2xy(mp, r, cell.length, plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mp}{A character string containing the path to a RAMAS Metapop .mp file.}

\item{r}{A character string containing the path to any of the raster files 
that were used by RAMAS Spatial Data for patch identification.}

\item{cell.length}{Numeric. The cell length of the grid, as specified in 
RAMAS Spatial Data (note: this may be different to the native resolution of
the grids).}

\item{plot}{Logical. Should the points be plotted? Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} containing the names of all populations referred 
  to in the .mp file, as well as their coordinates (in both Metapop and 
  original coordinate systems).
}
\description{
Extracts population coordinates from a RAMAS Metapop .mp file, and converts 
them back to the coordinate system of the original habitat suitability grids 
(i.e. the grids supplied to the RAMAS patch-identification module, patch.exe 
or, in more recent versions of RAMAS GIS, SpatialData.exe).
}
\note{
This has been tested for RAMAS version 5.1, and may produce unexpected
  results for other versions. Please verify that the returned coordinates are
  sensible by referring to the plot that is returned by this function.

mp <- system.file('example.mp', package='mptools')
