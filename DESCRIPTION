Title: RAMAS Metapop Tools
Description: RAMAS Metapop (https://www.ramas.com/ramas.htm#metapop) is a 
    popular tool for performing spatially-explicit population viability 
    analysis. It stores population model parameter settings and simulation 
    results in plain text (.mp) files. RAMAS software is GUI-driven, and offers 
    limited flexibility with respect to extraction of results for further 
    analysis/visualisation in, e.g., GIS or R. This package provides a means to 
    access, summarise and visualise model outputs.
