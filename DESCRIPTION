Title: RAMAS Metapop Tools
Description: 'RAMAS Metapop' <https://www.ramas.com/ramas.htm#metapop> is a 
    popular software package for performing spatially-explicit population 
    viability analysis. It is primarily GUI-driven, but can benefit from 
    integration into an R workflow, wherein model results can be subjected to 
    further analysis. 'RAMAS Metapop' stores metapopulation model parameter 
    settings and population dynamics simulation results in plain text files 
    (.mp files). This package facilitates access, summary and visualisation of 
    'RAMAS Metapop 5' outputs in order to better integrate 'RAMAS' analyses into 
    an R workflow.
